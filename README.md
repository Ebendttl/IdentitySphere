# IdentitySphere

## Decentralized Identity Verification Framework

IdentitySphere is a comprehensive smart contract solution for self-sovereign identity management on the blockchain. It enables users to create, manage, and verify digital identities with attribute attestations through a decentralized verification process.

## Overview

IdentitySphere provides a complete framework for decentralized identity management with the following core features:

- **Self-Sovereign Identity Creation**: Users can register their own decentralized identifiers (DIDs)
- **Attribute Management**: Add and manage identity attributes with built-in expiration
- **Verification System**: Trusted third-party verifiers can validate user attributes
- **Schema Registry**: Define and enforce standardized attribute schemas
- **Trust Scoring**: Maintain trust scores for verifiers in the ecosystem

## Key Components

### Identity Management
- Create and manage decentralized identifiers (DIDs)
- Store identity status, verification level, and recovery options
- Track identity creation and update timestamps

### Attribute System
- Add custom attributes to your identity
- Request and receive verification from trusted verifiers
- Time-based expiration for enhanced security

### Verification Framework
- Register as a trusted verifier in the network
- Build reputation through successful verifications
- Process verification requests with approval/rejection flows

### Schema Registry
- Define standardized attribute schemas
- Configure field validation rules and requirements
- Version control for schema evolution

## Technical Architecture

IdentitySphere is built using Clarity smart contracts with several interconnected data structures:

- **Data Maps**:
  - `identities`: Core identity records
  - `attributes`: Identity attribute storage
  - `verifiers`: Registered verification providers
  - `verification-requests`: Pending and completed verifications
  - `schema-registry`: Attribute schema definitions
  - `schema-fields`: Field specifications for schemas
  - `schema-endorsements`: Community endorsements for schemas

- **Key Features**:
  - Attribute expiration handling
  - Progressive trust levels
  - Verification request workflow
  - Schema validation rules

## Getting Started

### 1. Creating an Identity

```clarity
(contract-call? .identity-sphere register-identity "did:sphere:abc123xyz789")
```

### 2. Adding Attributes

```clarity
(contract-call? .identity-sphere add-attribute "email" "user@example.com")
```

### 3. Requesting Verification

```clarity
(contract-call? .identity-sphere request-verification "email")
```

### 4. Creating a Schema

```clarity
(contract-call? .identity-sphere register-schema "basic-profile" "Basic Profile" "1.0" u80)
```

## Security Considerations

- All verification requests are tracked on-chain
- Attributes expire after 365 days by default
- Verifiers must maintain minimum trust scores
- Contract includes owner-only administrative functions

## Future Development

- Cross-chain identity federation
- Zero-knowledge proof integration
- Reputation staking mechanisms
- Governance framework for schema standards
- Enhanced privacy controls
